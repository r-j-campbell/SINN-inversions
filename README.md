# SINN: Stokes Inversions based on Neural Networks

This repository accompanies the submission of our study on machine learning methods for spectropolarimetric inversion.

The code implements both MLP and Transformer architectures to infer solar atmospheric parameters from synthetic Stokes profiles.
