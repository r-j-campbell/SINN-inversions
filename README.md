# SINN: Stokes Inversions based on Neural Networks

This repository accompanies our study on machine learning methods for solar spectropolarimetric inversion.

We explore neural networks as fast and accurate alternatives to traditional inversion codes, with a focus on **multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)** and **Transformer architectures**. These models are trained on synthetic Stokes profiles and accompanying models from simulation snapshots, and learn to infer stratified atmospheric parameters as a function of optical depth.

## üìä Model Outputs

All models predict the following six atmospheric quantities as a function of optical depth:

1. Temperature  
2. Magnetic field strength  
3. Line-of-sight velocity  
4. Magnetic inclination  
5. Azimuth angle (sin(2œï))  
6. Azimuth angle (cos(2œï))

Predictions can be saved in standard FITS format for scientific analysis or comparison with traditional inversion results.
